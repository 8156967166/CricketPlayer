          Virat Kohli is an Indian cricketer and the current captain of the India national team. A right-handed top-order batsman, Kohli is regarded as one of the best contemporary batsmen in the world. He plays for Delhi in domestic cricket and for Royal Challengers Bangalore in the Indian Premier League (IPL) as captain of the franchise since 2013.

          Kohli captained India Under-19s to victory at the 2008 Under-19 World Cup in Malaysia. After a few months later, he made his ODI debut for India against Sri Lanka at the age of 19. Initially having played as a reserve batsman in the Indian team, he soon established himself as a regular in the ODI middle-order and was part of the squad that won the 2011 World Cup. He made his Test debut in 2011 and shrugged off the tag of "ODI specialist" by 2013 with Test hundreds in Australia and South Africa. Having reached the number one spot in the ICC rankings for ODI batsmen for the first time in 2013,[5] Kohli also found success in the Twenty20 format, winning the Man of the Tournament twice at the ICC World Twenty20 (in 2014 and 2016).

          Shikhar Dhawan (born 5 December 1985) is an Indian international cricketer and a former limited overs captain. A left-handed opening batsman and an occasional right-arm off break bowler, he plays for Delhi in first-class cricket and Delhi Capitals in the IPL. He played for the Indian Under-17 and Under-19 teams before making his first-class debut for Delhi in November 2004. At the 2013 Champions Trophy, 2015 World Cup and 2017 Champions Trophy, Dhawan was the leading run-scorer for India. He is the fastest Indian to reach 3,000 ODI runs. In December 2017, he became the 2nd fastest Indian to reach 4000 ODI runs. He was awarded the 'Player of the Tournament' for his exploits in the 2013 ICC Champions Trophy and became the third Indian after Sachin Tendulkar and Yuvraj Singh to win this award in ICC tournaments.
          
          Dhawan made his One Day International (ODI) debut against Australia in October 2010 at Visakhapatnam. His Test debut came against the same opposition in March 2013 at Mohali where he scored the fastest century by any batsman on Test debut and ended his innings with 187 runs from 174 balls.

          In August 2013, Dhawan recorded the then-second-highest individual score in a List A match when he scored 248 runs off 150 balls for India A against South Africa A at Pretoria. During the 4th ODI against South Africa in Johannesburg, he became the first Indian and ninth overall to score a century in his 100th ODI game. On 14 June 2018, against Afghanistan, Dhawan became the sixth batsman, and the first for India, to score a century before lunch on day one of a Test.

          Young KL Rahul is amongst the most talented opening batsmen in India’s next generation setup. He was a part of India's squad in the 2010 Under-19 World Cup and made his first-class debut later that year.
          He has never been one of those cricketers who has set the stage on fire or has been the talk of the town for his batting skills.

          Rahul has taken gentle strides over the years and made a name for himself for being a consistent performer in the domestic circles. He enjoyed a breakthrough 2013-14 season, laying the foundation for Karnataka's Ranji Trophy victory with 1033 runs, which included three centuries, three nineties, and a Man-of-the-Match performance in the final.

          Not surprisingly, Rahul attracted a lot of bids in the IPL player auctions and ended up with the Sunrisers Hyderabad in the 2014 season. He has received much praise from some of the legends of the game namely Rahul Dravid. His consistent performances in India’s A tour of Australia and the 2014-15 domestic season earned him a Test call up for India’s tour of Australia.

          Rishabh Rajendra Pant (born 4 October 1997) is an Indian cricketer who plays as a middle order wicket-keeper batsman for India, Delhi, and the Delhi Capitals in the Indian Premier League. In December 2015, he was named in India's squad for the 2016 Under-19 Cricket World Cup. On 1 February 2016, during the tournament, Pant hit an 18-ball fifty, the fastest at this level.

          He made his Twenty20 International (T20I) debut for India in January 2017, his Test debut in August 2018, and his One Day International (ODI) debut in October 2018. In January 2019, Pant was named the ICC Emerging Player of the Year at the 2018 ICC Awards. In February 2021, Pant was named the Men's Player of the Month in the first edition of the ICC Player of the Month Awards.
          
          Rishabh Pant was born in Roorkee, Uttarakhand, India to Rajendra Pant and Saroj Pant. At the age of 12, Pant would travel with his mother to Delhi during the weekends to get trained under Tarak Sinha at the Sonnet Cricket Academy. He and his mother stayed at a gurdwara in Moti Bagh locality as they did not have a place to stay in the city. Sinha suggested Pant to switch to Rajasthan to play U-13 and U-15 cricket but to no avail. Pant was told by his mentor to overhaul his entire batting technique which based on Hand-eye co-ordination to become a better batsman. His turning point came when he was playing U-19 cricket for Delhi against Assam. Pant had top-scored with 35 but was severely reprimanded by the coach for giving his wicket away at a hat-trick. He then hit 150 in the second innings which he claims was the most important knock in his career.

          He was termed as “The Rockstar” by Shane Warne when Ravindra Jadeja took the Indian Premier League by storm in 2008 with his all-round heroics. An eccentric fielder, a more than handy left-arm spinner and a fearless batsman, Jadeja had all the qualities of a utility cricketer.
          Though predominantly known for his performances for the Rajasthan Royals in the IPL, not many notice his efforts in the longer format of the game. The left-handed batsman has three triple centuries to his name with a first-class average close to 50. He paved his way to the national side amassing 739 runs and 42 wickets in the 2008-09 Ranji season. He made his ODI debut in 2009 against Sri Lanka and has been a key player in the Indian line-up since.

          It took him three more years after his ODI debut to make it into the Test side and India now see him as a good variety in the bowling attack and more than a handy bat lower down the order. International cricket aside, Jadeja has also been a vital cog in the wheel for his IPL franchise – Chennai Super Kings. He was purchased for a whopping sum by the franchise in 2012 and has been one of their marquee players ever since.

A big hitter and a fast-bowling all-rounder, Hardik ticks all the boxes that a team desires from an all-rounder.

After his remarkable performances in domestic cricket, Shami slowly made his way into the international team in 2013 when he made his ODI debut. His ability to reverse swing the old white ball made him an indispensable asset in the limited-overs format. He made a mark in 2015 World Cup held in Australia by taking 17 wickets and ending up as one of the highest wicket-takers in the tournament. It was later revealed that he played the World Cup through a knee injury.
          Shami then made his debut in the red ball cricket against West Indies in a home series and in the two-match series; he to took 11 wickets.

          Bhuvneshwar Kumar belongs to that breed of bowlers who can swing the ball prodigiously both ways at a decent pace. There has often been the talk of “had he been a few yards faster, he could have been lethal” but that has never been an area of concern for him as he realizes his limitations as a bowler and believes in focussing on his skill set rather than pace. He is often compared to his fellow UP seamer Praveen Kumar who hogged the limelight for swinging the ball considerably beating the best in the business during his hay days.

          Representing Uttar Pradesh in the domestic circuit, Bhuvneshwar Kumar was known for his smart cricketing brain and being a captain’s go-to bowler. His efforts reaped benefits as he made his ODI debut in 2012 against Pakistan.

          Kumar impressed everyone as he got a wicket in his very first ball of his first over in ODIs sending Mohammad Hafeez back to the pavilion with an outstanding in-swinger. Kumar later ended up with figures of 2/27 in nine overs with an economy of three. Kumar’s rise in international cricket has been impressive since then as he got a Test call-up in 2013 against Australia. Still early days in international cricket for the seamer, but Kumar has already shown his tremendous potential with the bat and ball.

          He does have a first-class century to his name and has shown immense confidence batting lower down the order for India. He was impressive in his first overseas tour to England and even got his name on the Lord’s Honours Board picking up a 6-wicket haul in the second Test against England in 2014.
